# Test with coverage
For launch and generate the jacoco code coverage:
I use the intelliJ IDE, for other IDEs there must be an equivalent to launch the tests. 
To run the coverage report:
- Right-click on the src/main/test/java folder
- Click on "More Run/debug"
- Click on "Run test in 'java' with coverage".
An htmlReport folder is created.
- Click htmlReport folder
- Open the 'index.html' file.
This file is a web page that contains the Back-end coverage report.
